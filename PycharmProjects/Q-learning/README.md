This is a simulation of a shared autonomous electric vehicle fleet.
As it is the first project, it contains many bugs and problems currently and needs to be extended.
At the moment, there are a few numbers of vehicles belonging to the fleet that serve mobility-on-demand requests.
Momently, the most critical problem is that events do not have overlap, meaning that they do not happen before one 
is finished.
For example, while serving a request or charging, we receive no request.
The next extension is that instead of one charging station, there are a significant number of them which distributed within
the service region.
